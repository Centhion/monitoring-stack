# Enterprise Monitoring and Dashboarding Platform

A fork-and-deploy monitoring platform template built on the Grafana observability stack. Ships with production-ready configs, dashboards, alert rules, fleet deployment tooling, and a Helm chart for Kubernetes. Supports mixed Windows and Linux server environments.

## Purpose

Provide centralized infrastructure monitoring, log aggregation, alerting, and dashboarding for enterprise Windows and Linux servers using open-source tooling. All configurations -- dashboards, alert rules, agent configs, and provisioning -- are version-controlled and reproducible.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Role |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Agent | Grafana Alloy | Unified telemetry collector on every server (metrics + logs) |
| Metrics | Prometheus (Phase 1), Mimir (Phase 2) | Time-series metrics ingestion and querying |
| Logs | Loki | Label-based log aggregation |
| Alerting | Alertmanager + Grafana Alerting | Alert routing, grouping, deduplication, notifications |
| Visualization | Grafana | Dashboards, exploration, alert management UI |
| Notifications | Microsoft Teams (webhook) | Alert delivery to operations team |

## Modular by Design

This repository is a comprehensive reference stack, not an all-or-nothing deployment. Every component is optional and can be enabled, disabled, or swapped to match your environment:

- **Using Grafana Cloud?** Drop the local Grafana, Prometheus, and Alertmanager configs — keep only the Alloy agent configs and dashboards.
- **Don't need RBAC/LDAP?** Remove `configs/grafana/ldap/` and the RBAC scripts — Grafana works fine with built-in auth.
- **Scaling beyond Prometheus?** The stack includes a Mimir migration path for long-term, horizontally-scalable metrics storage.
- **No network devices?** Skip the SNMP and Redfish configs entirely — the core server monitoring stands on its own.
- **Windows-only or Linux-only?** Pull just the OS-specific Alloy configs and dashboards you need.

Treat this as a parts catalog: fork it, strip what you don't need, and customize what you keep.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/Monitoring_Dashboarding.git
cd Monitoring_Dashboarding

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your environment-specific values (webhook URLs, endpoints, etc.)

# Start the full stack locally via Docker Compose
python scripts/poc_setup.py

# Open Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (admin / admin)
```

## Features

- **Configuration as Code**: All monitoring configs, dashboards, and alert rules stored in Git
- **Mixed OS Support**: Alloy agent configs for both Windows Server and Linux
- **Hub-and-Spoke Dashboards**: Enterprise NOC for multi-site overview, Site Overview for per-site drill-down, plus dedicated Windows, Linux, and IIS dashboards with cross-navigation
- **Industry-Standard Alert Rules**: Alert rules based on SRE best practices and community thresholds
- **Teams Integration**: Alert notifications delivered to Microsoft Teams channels
- **Grafana Provisioning**: Datasources, dashboards, and contact points deployed via provisioning YAML
- **Label-Driven Discovery**: Add sites by setting `ALLOY_DATACENTER` on agents -- dashboards auto-populate with no config changes
- **SNMP Network Monitoring**: Poll switches, firewalls, APs, and UPS devices via Alloy's embedded snmp_exporter with per-interface traffic, utilization, and error tracking
- **SNMP Trap Ingestion**: Receive SNMP traps via snmptrapd sidecar, forward through Alloy to Loki for log-based alerting on link-down, auth-failure, and device-reboot events
- **Hardware Health via Redfish**: Monitor iLO/iDRAC BMC interfaces for system health, temperature, power consumption, and component status (drives, memory)
- **SSL/TLS Certificate Monitoring**: Blackbox probing for internal PKI and public certificates with 30d/7d/expired alerting
- **Two-Tier Deployment**: Tier 1 Alloy agents push from servers; Tier 2 site gateway containers pull SNMP, certificates, and hardware metrics per site
- **Agentless Probing**: ICMP, TCP, UDP/DNS, and HTTP/HTTPS synthetic probes via blackbox exporter with success rate and latency tracking
- **File and Process Monitoring**: Textfile collector pattern for monitoring arbitrary file sizes, directory sizes, and process status on both Windows and Linux
- **SLA Availability Reporting**: Pre-computed availability metrics (1h/1d/7d/30d windows) per host, role, and site with configurable SLA threshold indicators
- **Capacity Forecasting**: predict_linear panels on Windows, Linux, and Infrastructure dashboards showing projected disk, CPU, and memory trends
- **Mass-Outage Detection**: Automatic alert suppression during site-wide or role-wide outages via recording rules and Alertmanager inhibition
- **Maintenance Windows**: Grafana mute timings (recurring) and API-driven programmatic silences with a Python helper script
- **Audit Trail**: Grafana server log forwarding to Loki for login tracking, dashboard changes, and API activity visibility
- **Cloud Monitoring Stubs**: Pre-built Alloy configs for AWS CloudWatch and Azure Monitor (disabled by default, ready to activate)
- **Validation Tooling**: Python scripts to lint and validate configs before deployment
- **Fleet Inventory System**: YAML-based site/host registry with CSV import, Ansible playbook for bulk Alloy deployment, and Prometheus tag compliance auditing
- **RBAC and LDAP/AD Integration**: Grafana folder-based access control with LDAP config template, team provisioning, and API-driven permission management scripts
- **Full Docker Compose Stack**: Blackbox exporter, snmptrapd, and Redfish exporter services alongside core Prometheus/Loki/Alertmanager/Grafana
- **Complete Helm Chart**: Kubernetes deployment with templates for all services, value overlays for dev/staging/production, and optional SNMP/Redfish/LDAP components

All dashboards include a cross-navigation link bar. Template variables (`environment`, `datacenter`, `hostname`) propagate between dashboards for seamless drill-down.
