---

## Phase 1: Alloy Agent Configurations

**Goal**: Create production-ready Grafana Alloy configurations for Windows and Linux servers with role-specific collection profiles, standard label taxonomy, and modular architecture.

**Status**: Completed

**Architecture**: Modular directory-based configs. Alloy loads all `.alloy` files in a directory via `alloy run <dir>`. Deploy common/ + os/base + os/logs + role files per server.

**Config Syntax**: Alloy syntax (HCL-inspired, formerly River). File extension: `.alloy`. Environment variables via `sys.env()`.

### Tasks -- Common Components

- [x] 1. Define standard label taxonomy (environment, datacenter, role, os, hostname) -- `configs/alloy/common/labels.alloy`
- [x] 2. Create Prometheus remote_write endpoint -- `configs/alloy/common/remote_write.alloy`
- [x] 3. Create Loki push endpoint -- `configs/alloy/common/loki_push.alloy`

### Tasks -- Windows Configs

- [x] 4. Create Windows base OS metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network, services) -- `configs/alloy/windows/base.alloy`
- [x] 5. Create Windows Event Log collection (System, Application, Security) -- `configs/alloy/windows/logs_eventlog.alloy`
- [x] 6. Create Windows role: Domain Controller (AD DS, replication, DNS, Kerberos) -- `configs/alloy/windows/role_dc.alloy`
- [x] 7. Create Windows role: SQL Server (perf counters, database metrics, error logs) -- `configs/alloy/windows/role_sql.alloy`
- [x] 8. Create Windows role: IIS Web Server (requests, app pools, error rates, IIS logs) -- `configs/alloy/windows/role_iis.alloy`
- [x] 9. Create Windows role: File Server (SMB sessions, DFS, disk I/O) -- `configs/alloy/windows/role_fileserver.alloy`

### Tasks -- Linux Configs

- [x] 10. Create Linux base OS metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network, systemd) -- `configs/alloy/linux/base.alloy`
- [x] 11. Create Linux journal log collection -- `configs/alloy/linux/logs_journal.alloy`
- [x] 12. Create Linux role: Docker host (container metrics, container logs) -- `configs/alloy/linux/role_docker.alloy`

### Tasks -- Documentation

- [x] 13. Create Alloy deployment guide for Windows and Linux -- `docs/ALLOY_DEPLOYMENT.md`

### PoC Validation Notes (Phase 5.5)

- Alloy v1.13 uses River block syntax (`service {}` not `service = {}`); fixed across all 6 Alloy configs
- Alloy v1.13 overrides scrape `job_name` with `integrations/windows`; added relabel rules to restore `windows_base`
- The `cs` collector was removed in v1.13; its metrics merged into `os`, `memory`, and `cpu` collectors
- `where_clause` inside the `service` block is deprecated (no-op in v1.13); retained for backward compatibility

### Risks

- SQL Server perf counters may need custom WMI queries if `prometheus.exporter.mssql` is unavailable in Alloy
- DC metrics depend on AD DS role being installed on the target server
- Component label uniqueness required across files loaded in same directory

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Deploy Alloy to one test Windows server (any role)
- [ ] Deploy Alloy to one test Linux server
- [ ] Provide endpoint URLs for Prometheus and Loki (when Phase 2 backends are deployed)
- [ ] Confirm list of Windows services to monitor per role (or accept defaults)

---

## Phase 2: Backend Configurations (Prometheus + Loki)

**Goal**: Production-ready server-side configs for Prometheus and Loki, including retention policies, recording rules, ingestion limits, and Grafana provisioning.

**Status**: Completed

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Create Prometheus server config (global, scrape, remote_write receiver, retention) -- `configs/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
- [x] 2. Create Prometheus recording rules (pre-computed aggregations for dashboard performance) -- `configs/prometheus/recording_rules.yml`
- [x] 3. Create Loki server config (storage, retention, limits, schema) -- `configs/loki/loki.yml`
- [x] 4. Create Grafana datasource provisioning (Prometheus + Loki endpoints) -- `configs/grafana/datasources/datasources.yml`
- [x] 5. Create Grafana dashboard provisioning (point to dashboards/ directory) -- `configs/grafana/dashboards/dashboards.yml`
- [x] 6. Document backend deployment requirements -- `docs/BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT.md`

### Implementation Notes

- Prometheus: 30d retention, 50GB size limit, WAL compression, remote_write receiver enabled
- Recording rules: 3 groups (Windows, Linux, Fleet) with pre-computed CPU/memory/disk/network aggregations
- Loki: Schema v13, TSDB store, 720h retention, 10MB/s ingestion limit, 10K stream limit
- Grafana: Datasource UIDs (prometheus, loki) used by all dashboards for portability

### Human Actions Required (Deferred Until Cluster Ready)

- [ ] Deploy Prometheus to Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Deploy Loki to Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Configure persistent storage volumes
- [ ] Verify data ingestion from Alloy agents

---

## Phase 3: Alerting Rules and Routing

**Goal**: Comprehensive alert rules for Windows and Linux servers based on industry best practices, Alertmanager routing with Teams integration, and operational runbook stubs.

**Status**: Completed

### Tasks

- [x] 7. Create Windows server alert rules (CPU, memory, disk, services, uptime) -- `alerts/prometheus/windows_alerts.yml`
- [x] 8. Create Linux server alert rules (CPU, memory, disk, systemd, load) -- `alerts/prometheus/linux_alerts.yml`
- [x] 9. Create infrastructure alert rules (Prometheus/Loki/Alertmanager health, fleet anomalies) -- `alerts/prometheus/infra_alerts.yml`
- [x] 10. Create role-specific alert rules (AD replication, SQL health, IIS errors, Docker daemon) -- `alerts/prometheus/role_alerts.yml`
- [x] 11. Create Alertmanager config (routing tree, receivers, grouping, inhibition) -- `configs/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml`
- [x] 12. Create Alertmanager Teams webhook template (Adaptive Card format) -- `configs/alertmanager/templates/teams.tmpl`
- [x] 13. Create Grafana notification provisioning (contact points, policies) -- `configs/grafana/notifiers/notifiers.yml`
- [x] 14. Document alert runbooks with investigation and remediation steps -- `docs/ALERT_RUNBOOKS.md`

### Implementation Notes

- 46 total alert rules across 4 files: Windows (10), Linux (13), Infrastructure (10), Role-specific (14)
- Alert rules reference recording rules from Phase 2 for consistent metric naming
- Alertmanager routing: critical -> Teams + email, warning -> Teams, info -> Teams (separate channel)
- Inhibition rules: server down suppresses warnings; notification failures suppress fleet alerts
- Teams template uses Adaptive Card JSON for rich formatting with severity, host, environment facts
- Full runbooks with investigation commands and remediation steps for every alert

### Human Actions Required (Deferred Until Cluster Ready)

- [ ] Create Teams Incoming Webhook in monitoring channel
- [ ] Deploy Alertmanager to Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Test alert delivery to Teams channel
- [ ] Review and approve alert thresholds
- [ ] Review alert thresholds against current monitoring requirements

---

## Phase 3.1: Alert Routing Enhancement

**Goal**: Extend Alertmanager routing to support site-based alert distribution via email, with templatized per-site distribution list mappings. The existing severity-based Teams routing remains unchanged. This enhancement adds a `datacenter` child-route layer so deployers can map each site to its own ops email DL by editing a single config block.

**Status**: Completed

**Prerequisite**: Phase 3 (complete)

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Add site-based `datacenter` child routes to `alertmanager.yml` routing tree
  - Insert `match_re: { datacenter: "<site-pattern>" }` children under each severity tier
  - Templatize with placeholder site names (site-a, site-b, site-c) so deployers replace values per fork
  - Preserve existing severity-based Teams routing (critical -> Teams + email, warning -> Teams, info -> Teams)
- [x] 2. Create per-site email receivers with templatized DL addresses
  - Pattern: `site_<name>_critical` receiver -> `site-<name>-ops@example.com`
  - Include both Teams webhook and email in critical/warning receivers per site
  - Use `example.com` placeholder domain throughout (deployers replace per fork)
- [x] 3. Add SMTP authentication fields to global config
  - `smtp_auth_username` and `smtp_auth_password` via environment variable substitution
  - Document env vars in `.env.example`
  - Verify Helm `values.yaml` already has `alertmanager.notifications.smtp.*` fields; add any missing
- [x] 4. Enhance Teams Adaptive Card template (`configs/alertmanager/templates/teams.tmpl`)
  - Iterate over all alerts in the group (current template only renders `[0]`)
  - Add Grafana dashboard deep-link using `dashboard_url` annotation
  - Add `datacenter` and `category` labels to the card facts
- [x] 5. Update Helm values and secrets for site-email mapping
  - Add `alertmanager.notifications.siteEmails` map in `values.yaml` (site name -> DL address)
  - Update `alertmanager-secret.yaml` template to inject site email values
  - Ensure SMTP password flows through Kubernetes Secret, not plain text
- [x] 6. Sync Grafana contact points (`configs/grafana/notifiers/notifiers.yml`)
  - Add per-site notification policies mirroring Alertmanager site routing
  - Maintain Grafana as the secondary routing path (Alertmanager is primary)
- [x] 7. Update `.env.example` with new environment variables
  - `SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME`, `SMTP_AUTH_PASSWORD`
  - `SMTP_SMARTHOST` (already present, verify)
  - Document per-site email DL convention
- [x] 8. Validate and test routing
  - Run `scripts/validate_prometheus.py` against updated Alertmanager config
  - Verify route matching logic with `amtool config routes test` examples in docs
  - Update `docs/ALERT_RUNBOOKS.md` with site-routing explanation

### Design Notes

- **Template philosophy**: All site names and email addresses use obvious placeholders (`site-a`, `site-b`, `site-a-ops@example.com`). Deployers fork the repo and replace these values for their environment. The routing structure itself requires no changes.
- **Routing hierarchy**: `severity` (existing) -> `datacenter` (new) -> receiver. This means a critical alert from `site-a` routes to `site_a_critical` (Teams + site-a email DL), while a critical alert from `site-b` routes to `site_b_critical` (Teams + site-b email DL).
- **Fallback**: A default receiver catches any datacenter not explicitly mapped, ensuring no alerts are dropped during incremental site onboarding.
- **Extend, not rebuild**: The existing routing tree, inhibition rules, Teams template, and Helm/Docker integration are production-quality. This phase layers site routing on top without restructuring what works.

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Provide SMTP relay details (smarthost, port, TLS requirements)
- [ ] Define per-site email distribution lists (or confirm `<site>-ops@company.com` convention)
- [ ] Test email delivery from the cluster network to the SMTP relay
- [ ] Review and approve routing logic before production deployment

---

## Phase 4: Grafana Dashboards

**Goal**: Pre-built dashboard JSON files querying the exact metrics from our Alloy configs, with template variables for fleet-wide filtering.

**Status**: Completed

### Tasks

- [x] 15. Build Windows Server overview dashboard (CPU, memory, disk, network, services) -- `dashboards/windows/windows_overview.json`
- [x] 16. Build Linux Server overview dashboard (CPU, memory, disk, network, systemd) -- `dashboards/linux/linux_overview.json`
- [x] 17. Build Infrastructure Overview dashboard (fleet health, top-N, alert summary) -- `dashboards/overview/infrastructure_overview.json`
- [x] 18. Build Log Explorer dashboard (unified log search across Windows Event Log + Linux journal) -- `dashboards/overview/log_explorer.json`
- [x] 19. Document dashboard customization guide -- `docs/DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md`

### Implementation Notes

- Windows overview: 18 panels across 5 rows (overview stats, CPU/memory, disk, network, services)
- Linux overview: 23 panels across 6 rows (overview stats, CPU/load, memory/swap, disk, network, systemd)
- Infrastructure overview: 21 panels across 5 rows (fleet health, trends, top-N problems, alerts, availability)
- Log Explorer: 7 panels using LogQL against Loki (volume graphs, Windows/Linux log streams, unified search)
- All dashboards use recording rule metrics for consistent queries
- Template variables: environment, datacenter, hostname, role (multi-select with All option)
- Datasource UIDs: prometheus, loki (matching provisioning config)

### Human Actions Required (Deferred Until Cluster Ready)

- [ ] Deploy Grafana to Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Configure Grafana authentication (AD/LDAP integration)
- [ ] Review dashboards with operations team
- [ ] Provide feedback on layout and metric selection

---

## Phase 5: Validation Tooling

**Goal**: Python scripts to validate all config types before deployment, runnable locally and in CI.

**Status**: Completed

### Tasks

- [x] 20. Create Alloy config validator (syntax structure, required components, env var usage) -- `scripts/validate_alloy.py`
- [x] 21. Create Prometheus/Alertmanager YAML validator (schema, required fields, label compliance) -- `scripts/validate_prometheus.py`
- [x] 22. Create Grafana dashboard JSON validator (schema, template vars, panel completeness) -- `scripts/validate_dashboards.py`
- [x] 23. Create unified validation runner (runs all validators, outputs report) -- `scripts/validate_all.py`
- [x] 24. Create test fixtures and expected outputs -- `tests/`
- [x] 25. Create requirements.txt for validation dependencies -- `requirements.txt`
- [x] 26. Document tooling usage -- `docs/VALIDATION_TOOLING.md`

### Implementation Notes

- Alloy validator: brace balancing, required component patterns, duplicate labels, hardcoded endpoints/secrets
- Prometheus validator: YAML syntax, rule group structure, duration formats, receiver/route consistency
- Dashboard validator: JSON syntax, UID uniqueness, datasource references, template vars, grid overlap detection
- Unified runner: orchestrates all validators, supports --verbose and --strict modes
- Test suite: 12 tests (fixtures for valid + invalid configs per validator type), all passing
- PyYAML is the only external dependency (requirements.txt)

### Human Actions Required (Deferred Until CI Pipeline Ready)

- [ ] Integrate validation into CI/CD pipeline

---

## Phase 5.5: Docker Compose PoC Environment

**Goal**: Spin up the full monitoring stack locally via Docker Desktop to validate configs, dashboards, alert routing, and the Alloy-to-backend data pipeline before deploying to Kubernetes.

**Status**: Completed

**Resource Budget**: ~2 GB RAM total (memory-limited containers for developer workstations)

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Create `docker-compose.yml` with Prometheus, Loki, Alertmanager, Grafana -- volume mounts, memory limits, health checks
- [x] 2. Create `docker-compose.override.yml` for local dev (debug ports, verbose logging)
- [x] 3. Create `.dockerignore` to exclude non-essential files
- [x] 4. Create local Alloy config for Windows host pointing at Docker stack -- `configs/alloy/local/`
- [x] 5. Create `scripts/poc_setup.py` for one-command startup with health validation
- [x] 6. Create `docs/LOCAL_TESTING.md` step-by-step guide
- [x] 7. Update PROJECT_PLAN.md to mark phase complete

### Implementation Notes

- Prometheus and Alertmanager do not support `${VAR:-default}` env var substitution; configs use literal Docker service names
- Prometheus volume mounts at `/prometheus` (image default) not `/prometheus/data` to avoid permission issues with `nobody` user
- Alloy runs as standalone binary (not MSI service) for PoC; pointed at `configs/alloy/local/`
- Full data pipeline validated: Alloy -> Prometheus (121 metrics, 4698 series), Alloy -> Loki (System + Application event logs)
- Recording rules evaluating successfully (e.g., `instance:windows_cpu_utilization:ratio`)

### Risks

- Memory pressure on developer workstation (mitigated with container limits)
- Alloy Windows binary collector names may differ from documentation (validate during local testing)
- Teams webhook requires real URL for notification testing (fallback: stdout logging)

### Human Actions Required

- [x] Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running
- [x] Download Grafana Alloy Windows binary (standalone zip, not MSI installer)
- [ ] Stop/disable MSI-installed Alloy Windows service (requires admin terminal)
- [ ] Create Teams webhook URL (optional, alerts log to stdout as fallback)

---

## Phase 5.7: Fleet Tagging and Ansible Deployment Tooling

**Goal**: Create a centralized inventory system for datacenter/role/environment tag assignment and Ansible playbooks to deploy Alloy with correct tags to 500-2000 servers across 5-15+ sites.

**Status**: Completed

**Fleet Context**: Inventory is AD-independent by design to support multi-domain environments. Sites use short abbreviation codes (SITE-A, SITE-B, etc.). Multi-role servers are common (e.g., SQL + IIS on same host).

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Create site registry -- `inventory/sites.yml`
  - Central YAML defining all datacenter sites with metadata: code, display name, environment, timezone, AD domain, network segment
  - Controlled vocabulary for valid roles: `dc, sql, iis, fileserver, docker, generic, exchange, print, app`
  - Document extension point for adding new roles and OS types
  - Complexity: Simple

- [x] 2. Create host inventory schema -- `inventory/hosts.yml`
  - YAML mapping every server to its tags: hostname, site (references sites.yml), environment, roles (list for multi-role), os_type, os_build
  - Multi-role support: roles field is a list (e.g., `[sql, iis]`)
  - OS build tracked as precise version strings (e.g., `"10.0.20348"` for Server 2022, `"9.5"` for RHEL 9.5)
  - Organized by site for readability, with schema header documenting valid values
  - Complexity: Simple

- [x] 3. Create inventory tooling -- `scripts/fleet_inventory.py`
  - Subcommand: `validate` -- validates hosts.yml against sites.yml (site codes, roles, os_type, required fields, no duplicate hostnames, warns on 3+ roles)
  - Subcommand: `import-csv` -- converts CSV (from SCCM/CMDB export) to hosts.yml entries, merges without duplicates
  - Subcommand: `generate-ansible` -- produces Ansible inventory with host groups by site/role/os/environment, host_vars for Alloy env vars, group_vars for endpoints and site metadata
  - Subcommand: `stats` -- prints fleet summary (servers per site, per role, per OS, multi-role count, coverage gaps)
  - Output directory: `inventory/generated/`
  - Complexity: Medium

- [x] 4. Create Ansible playbook for Alloy deployment -- `ansible/deploy_alloy.yml`
  - Ansible role `alloy_windows`: install MSI, deploy configs, set system env vars, configure and start service
  - Ansible role `alloy_linux`: install package, deploy configs, set env file, configure systemd unit, start service
  - Multi-role handling: copies role_*.alloy for EACH role in the host's roles list; ALLOY_ROLE set to primary (first) role
  - Config deployment: common/*.alloy (always) + {os}/base.alloy + logs (always) + role_*.alloy (per role list)
  - Environment variables set: ALLOY_ENV, ALLOY_DATACENTER, ALLOY_ROLE, PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_WRITE_URL, LOKI_WRITE_URL, plus role-specific vars
  - Post-deploy validation: waits for :12345 health endpoint, verifies metrics are being scraped
  - Complexity: Medium

- [x] 5. Create tag validation script -- `scripts/validate_fleet_tags.py`
  - Queries Prometheus to audit tag compliance across the fleet
  - Report categories: COMPLIANT (correct tags), DRIFT (wrong tags), MISSING (in inventory but not reporting), UNKNOWN (reporting but not in inventory)
  - Filters: `--site`, `--role`, `--environment`
  - Output formats: `--format table|json|csv`
  - Accepts `--prometheus-url` (defaults to PROMETHEUS_URL env var)
  - Complexity: Medium

- [x] 6. Create onboarding runbook -- `docs/FLEET_ONBOARDING.md`
  - Step-by-step guide: adding a new site, adding servers, bulk CSV import, decommissioning
  - Documents how to extend the role vocabulary and OS type list in sites.yml
  - Troubleshooting section for common deployment issues (WinRM, permissions, config conflicts)
  - Complexity: Simple

### Architecture Notes

- **Site metadata inheritance**: Hosts reference a site code; timezone, AD domain, and network segment come from sites.yml automatically. No duplication per host.
- **Multi-role deployment**: Alloy loads all `.alloy` files in its config directory. Multiple role_*.alloy files coexist without conflict because each uses unique component labels (e.g., `prometheus.exporter.mssql "role_sql"`, `prometheus.exporter.iis "role_iis"`).
- **ALLOY_ROLE for multi-role hosts**: Set to the primary (first) role in the list. All role configs are loaded regardless. The role label in Prometheus is the primary role; dashboards and alerts filter by it.
- **OS build precision**: Free-form string field, not constrained to an enum. Captures exact build (e.g., `"10.0.17763.6893"` for a fully-patched Server 2019). Alloy also reports OS version as a metric label for runtime validation.
- **Extensibility**: New roles are added by (1) adding to `valid_roles` in sites.yml, (2) creating a `role_*.alloy` config in the appropriate OS directory, (3) documenting in FLEET_ONBOARDING.md.

### Risks

- WinRM connectivity: Ansible managing Windows requires WinRM or OpenSSH. Most enterprise Windows fleets use WinRM with CredSSP or Kerberos auth. Mitigation: Document WinRM prerequisites; test one server first.
- Domain consolidation: ~16 domains means Kerberos auth for Ansible may need multi-domain credential handling. Mitigation: Inventory tracks AD domain per site; Ansible can use per-host credentials or a service account with cross-domain trust.
- Multi-role config conflicts: Two role configs in the same Alloy directory must not have conflicting component labels. Mitigation: Existing role configs use unique labels. Validation script checks for conflicts.
- Hostname changes during domain migration: Servers may be renamed. Mitigation: Update hosts.yml; tag validation catches drift. Alloy uses constants.hostname (auto-detected).

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Provide complete list of datacenter site codes with display name, timezone, AD domain, network segment
- [ ] Provide initial host inventory (hostname, site, roles, OS type, OS build) -- CSV from SCCM, AD, or CMDB preferred
- [ ] Ensure WinRM is enabled on target Windows servers (or OpenSSH)
- [ ] Ensure SSH key access to target Linux servers from Ansible control node
- [ ] Provide production Prometheus/Loki endpoint URLs
- [ ] Designate one Windows and one Linux test server for initial deployment validation

## Phase 5.8: Generalization and Kubernetes Deployment Readiness

**Goal**: Strip all org-specific content, restructure the repository as a fork-and-deploy template, and add a Helm chart for production Kubernetes deployment. Preserve Docker Compose local testing as the development workflow.

**Status**: Complete (all 8 tasks done; Helm lint deferred to device with Helm CLI)

**Model**: Fork-and-deploy. Users fork the repo, edit `values.yaml` and `.env`, and deploy. No generator scripts or setup wizards.

**Helm Chart Strategy**: Start minimal, iterate with testing. Three maturity phases:
- **Phase A (this task)**: Single-replica, no Ingress, no TLS, no LDAP. Just the 4 services with ConfigMaps, Secrets, and PVCs. Validate with `helm template`, `helm lint`, and dry-run install.
- **Phase B (future)**: Add optional Ingress, TLS termination, resource tuning, and node affinity/tolerations after Phase A is confirmed working on a real cluster.
- **Phase C (future)**: Add LDAP/OAuth auth, HA replicas, horizontal pod autoscaling, and Mimir migration path when scaling requires it.

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Strip org-specific content from all files
  - Generalized all documentation, configs, agent prompts, and dashboard descriptions
  - Replaced org-specific GitHub URLs, datacenter names, user paths with generic placeholders
  - Cleared session history containing debug context
  - Fixed deprecated `env("COMPUTERNAME")` with `constants.hostname` in local Alloy config
  - Final grep sweep confirmed zero matches for org-specific terms
  - Complexity: Medium

- [x] 2. Restructure deployment directories
  - Moved `docker-compose.yml` to `deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml`
  - Moved `docker-compose.override.yml` to `deploy/docker/docker-compose.override.yml`
  - Created convenience wrappers `dc.sh` (bash) and `dc.ps1` (PowerShell) at repo root
  - Created `deploy/helm/` directory structure for Helm chart
  - Updated all documentation, scripts, and `.dockerignore` to reference new paths
  - Updated `scripts/poc_setup.py` with `COMPOSE_FILE` constant, `--env-file` support, and `_compose_base_cmd()` helper
  - Complexity: Medium

- [x] 3. Create Helm chart (Phase A -- minimal, single-replica)
  - Directory: `deploy/helm/monitoring-stack/`
  - Chart.yaml with metadata, appVersion, chart version 0.1.0, phase roadmap comments
  - values.yaml with all configurable values, conservative defaults, fleet sizing guidance, and Phase B/C stubs
  - templates/_helpers.tpl with name, fullname, labels, selectorLabels, componentFullname, namespace helpers
  - Prometheus: StatefulSet, Service (ClusterIP), ConfigMap (prometheus.yml + recording rules), ConfigMap (alert rules), volumeClaimTemplate
  - Loki: StatefulSet, Service, ConfigMap (loki.yml), volumeClaimTemplate
  - Alertmanager: Deployment, Service, ConfigMap (alertmanager.yml + teams.tmpl), Secret (webhook URL, SMTP creds)
  - Grafana: Deployment, Service, ConfigMap (provisioning: datasources, dashboards, notifiers), ConfigMap (dashboard JSON per category), PVC, Secret (admin password with existingSecret support)
  - NOTES.txt post-install instructions with port-forward commands and next steps
  - Packaging scripts: `package-chart.sh` and `package-chart.ps1` copy repo configs into chart files/ directory
  - Phase B/C features stubbed in values.yaml as `enabled: false` (Ingress, TLS, LDAP, HA)
  - Helm lint/template validation deferred -- Helm not installed on dev workstation
  - Complexity: Complex

  **Risk mitigation (Helm chart)**:
  - Start with `helm template` output review before any cluster install
  - Each service template validated independently against official image docs
  - ConfigMap content injected from same config files used by Docker Compose via packaging scripts (single source of truth)
  - values.yaml documents every field with inline comments, default rationale, and fleet sizing guidance
  - PVC sizes default conservatively (10Gi for PoC) with comments on production sizing
  - Resource requests/limits included with conservative defaults; comments explain scaling guidance
  - Chart version 0.1.0 signals pre-production maturity; semver tracks breaking changes

- [x] 4. Create values overlay examples
  - `deploy/helm/examples/values-minimal.yaml`: 2 required fields (Teams webhook, Grafana password) with usage instructions
  - `deploy/helm/examples/values-production.yaml`: Full production config with 50Gi PVCs, 30d retention, realistic resource limits, fleet sizing guidance, Phase B/C stubs as commented examples
  - `deploy/helm/examples/values-development.yaml`: Lightweight for dev/staging (5Gi PVCs, 3-7d retention, reduced memory, anonymous Grafana access)
  - Each file heavily commented explaining what each value does and when to change it
  - Complexity: Simple

- [x] 5. Create QUICKSTART.md
  - Section A: Local Testing (Docker Compose) -- 5 minute path with convenience wrappers
  - Section B: Production Kubernetes (Helm) -- 15 minute path with packaging and overlay workflow
  - Section C: What to Customize (alert thresholds, dashboards, notification channels, Alloy roles)
  - Section D: Adding Servers (pointer to Phase 5.7 fleet onboarding)
  - Architecture diagram showing data flow
  - Written for someone who just forked the repo and wants to see it running
  - Complexity: Simple

- [x] 6. Generalize Phase 5.7 inventory examples
  - Replaced org-specific site codes with generic placeholders (SITE-A, SITE-B, SITE-C) in PROJECT_PLAN.md
  - Replaced org-specific domain references with example.com
  - Kept all architecture decisions intact (multi-role, OS build precision, Ansible-first)
  - Complexity: Simple

- [x] 7. Update .gitignore and clean artifacts
  - Added `deploy/helm/monitoring-stack/files/*` (populated at package time, not committed)
  - Added `deploy/helm/monitoring-stack/charts/` for Helm dependencies
  - Added `inventory/generated/` for fleet inventory output
  - Added `*.tgz` for Helm packaged charts
  - Verified .env, CLAUDE.local.md, and settings.local.json are gitignored
  - Updated `.dockerignore` with deploy/helm/ and inventory/ exclusions
  - Complexity: Simple

- [x] 8. Final validation sweep
  - Docker Compose: `docker compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml config` -- PASSED (all 4 services, all bind mount paths resolve correctly)
  - Validators: `python scripts/validate_all.py` -- ALL PASSED (27 files, 2 expected warnings on local Alloy URLs)
  - Grep sweep: zero matches for org-specific terms (SCOM, Squared Up, Centhion, etamez, denver, RDU7)
  - Helm lint: DEFERRED -- Helm CLI not installed on dev workstation; requires `helm lint` on target machine
  - Tests: DEFERRED -- pytest not installed; requires `pip install pytest`
  - **Human action required**: Install Helm and run `helm lint deploy/helm/monitoring-stack/` + `helm template` to validate chart before first cluster deployment
  - Complexity: Medium

### Architecture Notes

- **Single source of truth for configs**: The same YAML/JSON config files are used by both Docker Compose (bind mounts) and Helm (ConfigMap content). No duplication. Helm templates read from the same `configs/` and `alerts/` directories.
- **Fork-and-deploy model**: Users fork the repo, edit `deploy/helm/values.yaml` (or copy an example overlay), and run `helm install`. For local testing, they edit `.env` and run `docker compose up`. The repo IS the deployment artifact.
- **Helm chart maturity phases**: Phase A (minimal) ships first. Phase B (Ingress, TLS) and Phase C (auth, HA) are additive -- existing values.yaml fields are preserved, new ones are added. No breaking changes across phases.
- **Directory restructure**: `deploy/docker/` and `deploy/helm/` cleanly separate the two deployment modes. Config files remain in `configs/`, `dashboards/`, `alerts/` at the repo root -- shared by both.

### Risk Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation | Verification |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Helm chart produces invalid K8s YAML | Validate every template with `helm template --debug` before any cluster install | `helm lint` + `helm template` in task #8 |
| Docker Compose breaks after directory move | Test full stack startup after restructure; update all path references | Docker Compose up + Alloy data flow in task #8 |
| Org-specific content missed during cleanup | Automated grep sweep for known terms as final gate | Grep sweep in tasks #1 and #8 |
| Helm ConfigMaps diverge from source configs | Templates use `.Files.Get` to inject config file content directly; no manual copy | Template review in task #3 |
| values.yaml defaults are unsafe for production | Conservative defaults (small PVCs, low memory); production overlay shows recommended values | values-production.yaml in task #4 |
| Chart version confusion | Semantic versioning from 0.1.0; CHANGELOG in chart documents breaking changes | Chart.yaml version field |

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Review Helm values.yaml defaults before chart is finalized
- [ ] Test Helm chart against a real K8s cluster after Phase A dry-run validation
- [ ] Choose a license for the repo (currently placeholder)
- [ ] Review final repo state for any remaining org-specific references

- [ ] Configure object storage backend (S3 or Azure Blob)
- [ ] Update Alloy remote_write targets to point to Mimir
- [ ] Migrate recording rules from Prometheus to Mimir ruler
- [ ] Validate dashboard queries work against Mimir
- [ ] Performance test at expected scale

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Provision object storage bucket
- [ ] Deploy Mimir to Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Decommission standalone Prometheus
- [ ] Validate retention and query performance

---

## Phase 7A: SNMP Network Device Monitoring

**Goal**: Poll any SNMP-capable device (switches, routers, firewalls, UPS, NAS, PDUs) via native Alloy SNMP exporter and ingest SNMP traps as logs via snmptrapd-to-Loki pipeline.

**Status**: Completed (core deliverables; trap receiver, Helm, docs deferred)

**Fleet Context**: Cisco switches, Palo Alto firewalls, Ubiquiti network hardware. No Aruba/HPE or Fortinet network gear. Template designed for extensibility -- adding new vendor MIBs is documented.

**Integration Pattern**: SNMP monitoring runs on the Tier 2 Alloy Site Gateway container (one per site) alongside certificate probing and Redfish hardware polling. See Architecture Decisions for the two-tier deployment model.

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Create SNMP auth profiles -- `configs/alloy/gateway/snmp_auths.yml`
  - SNMPv2c community string profile and SNMPv3 authPriv/authNoPriv templates
  - Credentials via environment variables (never hardcoded)
  - Merges with built-in default modules (system, if_mib) via `config_merge_strategy = "merge"`

- [x] 2. Create unified site gateway SNMP config -- `configs/alloy/gateway/site_gateway.alloy`
  - Uses `prometheus.exporter.snmp "network"` with config_merge_strategy="merge"
  - Target blocks per device (uncomment per-site during deployment)
  - Modules: system, if_mib (all devices), paloalto, ubiquiti_unifi, apcups (vendor-specific)
  - Standard label injection: datacenter, environment, device_type, vendor, device_name
  - 60s scrape interval with 20s timeout

- [x] 3. Create SNMP device inventory template -- `configs/alloy/gateway/snmp_targets.yml`
  - Commented examples for each device type (Cisco switch, Palo Alto firewall, Ubiquiti AP, APC UPS)
  - Documents required fields: name, address, module, auth, labels

- [x] 4. Create SNMP recording rules -- `configs/prometheus/snmp_recording_rules.yml`
  - Interface-level: traffic rates (in/out/total), error rates, discard rates, utilization ratios
  - Site-level: device counts, interfaces down, high utilization count, error interface count

- [x] 5. Create Network Infrastructure dashboard -- `dashboards/network/network_overview.json`
  - 16-panel dashboard with device inventory table, interface status table
  - Traffic overview (inbound/outbound by device, stacked area)
  - Top 10 interface utilization with threshold lines (80% warning, 95% critical)
  - Error and discard rate timeseries
  - Template vars: environment, datacenter (site), device_type

- [x] 6. Create SNMP alert rules -- `alerts/prometheus/snmp_alerts.yml`
  - SNMPDeviceUnreachable (critical, 5m), SNMPDeviceReboot (warning)
  - SNMPInterfaceDown (warning, admin up / oper down)
  - SNMPInterfaceHighUtilization (warning, >85%, 15m), SNMPInterfaceSaturated (critical, >95%, 5m)
  - SNMPInterfaceErrors (warning, sustained >1 error/sec, 10m)

- [x] 7. Update Enterprise NOC dashboard -- Network Infrastructure row
  - Replaced placeholder with site-aggregated table: devices, devices down, interfaces down, high util, errors
  - Clickable site names linking to Network Infrastructure dashboard

- [x] 8. Update Site Overview dashboard -- Network Infrastructure row
  - Replaced placeholder with device table (status, uptime, IP, type, vendor)
  - Added traffic-by-device timeseries panel

- [x] 9. Create SNMP trap receiver pipeline (deferred)
  - snmptrapd sidecar, loki.source.syslog ingestion, trap_explorer dashboard
  - Deferred until trap ingestion use case is validated by the team

- [x] 10. Add SNMP to Helm chart (deferred)
  - Will be addressed during Phase 5.8 Helm chart work

- [x] 11. Documentation -- `docs/SNMP_MONITORING.md` (deferred)
  - Setup guide, adding devices, SNMPv3 auth, custom vendor MIBs

### Risks

- MIB diversity: vendor-specific MIBs are vast. Mitigation: ship modules for fleet vendors (Cisco, Palo Alto, Ubiquiti), document generator workflow for adding new vendors.
- SNMPv3 credential management: auth/priv passwords need secure storage. Mitigation: environment variables for credentials, Helm secrets for K8s deployment.
- Trap flood: noisy devices can overwhelm Loki ingestion. Mitigation: rate limiting in snmptrapd config, Loki stream limits already configured.

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Provide list of network device types and models in the fleet
- [ ] Provide SNMP community strings or SNMPv3 credentials
- [ ] Identify which devices should send traps (requires device-side configuration)
- [ ] Verify network access from monitoring stack to device management interfaces

---

## Phase 7B: Hardware/HCI Health Monitoring (Redfish)

**Goal**: Monitor HPE SimpliVity (iLO) and Dell (iDRAC) hardware health via Redfish API -- fans, PSUs, temperatures, physical disks, memory DIMMs, overall chassis status.

**Status**: Completed (core deliverables; exporter selection, Helm, docs deferred)

**Fleet Context**: Mixed HPE SimpliVity and Dell hardware. Firmware kept current -- no Redfish compatibility concerns.

**Integration Pattern**: Redfish monitoring runs on the Tier 2 Alloy Site Gateway via an external exporter sidecar (Alloy does not have a native Redfish component). The exporter runs alongside the gateway container and accepts BMC targets via the multi-target URL parameter pattern.

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Create Redfish scrape config in site gateway -- `configs/alloy/gateway/site_gateway.alloy`
  - `prometheus.scrape "redfish"` section (commented, uncomment per-site)
  - Multi-target pattern: `__param_target` passes BMC IP to exporter on localhost:9220
  - 120s scrape interval with 30s timeout (Redfish queries are heavier than SNMP)
  - Labels: device_name, vendor, device_type=server_bmc

- [x] 2. Create Redfish target inventory template -- `configs/alloy/gateway/redfish_targets.yml`
  - Reference template with examples for HPE iLO and Dell iDRAC servers
  - Documents required fields and label taxonomy (bmc_type, vendor, device_name)
  - Labels map to target block structure in site_gateway.alloy

- [x] 3. Create hardware recording rules -- `configs/prometheus/hardware_recording_rules.yml`
  - Server-level: max temperature, total power consumption per server
  - Site-level: monitored/unreachable/healthy/warning/critical counts, total power, max temperature

- [x] 4. Create Hardware Health dashboard -- `dashboards/hardware/hardware_overview.json`
  - 14-panel dashboard with health summary stats (monitored, healthy, warning, critical, unreachable, power)
  - Server inventory table with health/power/temp columns and color-coded cells
  - Temperature monitoring (peak per server, individual sensors filtered by server)
  - Power consumption (per server stacked, per site aggregate)
  - Component health (drives, memory) in collapsed section
  - Template vars: environment, datacenter, vendor, server

- [x] 5. Create hardware alert rules -- `alerts/prometheus/hardware_alerts.yml`
  - RedfishBMCUnreachable (warning, 10m)
  - RedfishHealthWarning (warning, 5m), RedfishHealthCritical (critical, 2m)
  - RedfishTemperatureHigh (warning, >75C), RedfishTemperatureCritical (critical, >85C)
  - RedfishServerPoweredOff (critical, BMC reachable but chassis off)
  - RedfishDriveUnhealthy (warning), RedfishMemoryUnhealthy (warning)

- [x] 6. Update Enterprise NOC dashboard -- Hardware Health row
  - Replaced placeholder with site-aggregated table: monitored, healthy, warning, critical, unreachable, max temp, power
  - Clickable site names linking to Hardware Health dashboard

- [x] 7. Update Site Overview dashboard -- Hardware Health row
  - Replaced placeholder with server health table (health, power state, temperature, power draw)
  - Clickable server names linking to Hardware Health dashboard

- [x] 8. Evaluate and select Redfish exporter (deferred)
  - Compare `idrac_exporter` vs `ipmi_exporter` vs community alternatives
  - Test against both iLO and iDRAC endpoints
  - Will be done during initial site gateway deployment

- [x] 9. Add Redfish exporter to Docker Compose / Helm chart (deferred)
  - Sidecar container definition alongside site gateway
  - Will be addressed during Phase 5.8 Helm chart work

- [x] 10. Documentation -- `docs/HARDWARE_MONITORING.md` (deferred)
  - Redfish API prerequisites, adding servers, credential security

### Risks

- Credential management: BMC passwords are sensitive. Mitigation: Helm secrets, environment variables, never stored in config files.
- Polling overhead: Redfish queries are heavier than SNMP. Mitigation: 60-120s scrape interval, hardware state changes slowly.
- Vendor metric differences: iLO and iDRAC may expose different Redfish schemas. Mitigation: exporter research task evaluates compatibility.

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Create read-only BMC service accounts for monitoring on iLO and iDRAC
- [ ] Provide BMC IP addresses or DNS names for monitored servers
- [ ] Verify network access from monitoring stack to BMC management network (often a separate VLAN)

## Phase 7C: SSL Certificate Monitoring

**Goal**: Track certificate expiry for all internal PKI and public DigiCert certificates with dashboards and proactive alerting. Accuracy is the top priority -- no certificate should expire unnoticed.

**Status**: Completed (Tasks 1-6 delivered; Tasks 7-9 deferred to deployment integration)

**Architecture Decision**: Blackbox probing (native Alloy component) selected as primary approach. DigiCert CertCentral API deferred (blackbox covers public certs via HTTPS probing).

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Research certificate data sources and recommend approach
  - Option A: Blackbox exporter (native Alloy) -- probes HTTPS/TLS endpoints, reports `probe_ssl_earliest_cert_expiry`
  - Option B: x509-certificate-exporter (standalone) -- scans cert files on disk for non-HTTP services
  - Option C: DigiCert CertCentral API -- direct public cert inventory for DigiCert-managed certs
  - Evaluate accuracy, coverage, and maintenance burden of each
  - Deliver written recommendation with trade-offs
  - Complexity: Medium (research)

- [x] 2. Create certificate endpoint inventory -- `configs/alloy/certs/endpoints.yml`
  - YAML list of HTTPS/TLS endpoints to probe (internal + public)
  - Fields: url, name, environment, cert_type (pki/public), owner
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: Task 1 (approach decision)

- [x] 3. Create Alloy blackbox config -- `configs/alloy/roles/role_cert_monitor.alloy`
  - `prometheus.exporter.blackbox` with http_2xx_tls module
  - Target list from endpoints.yml via `discovery.file`
  - Expose `probe_ssl_earliest_cert_expiry` metric
  - Support for non-HTTP TLS (LDAPS, SMTP/TLS) via tcp_tls module
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: Task 2

- [x] 4. Create blackbox module config -- `configs/alloy/certs/blackbox_modules.yml`
  - `http_2xx_tls` module: validate cert chain, follow redirects, configurable timeout
  - `tcp_tls` module: for non-HTTP TLS services (LDAPS on 636, SMTP/TLS on 587)
  - Internal CA trust: mount point for custom CA bundle
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: None

- [x] 5. Create Certificate Monitoring dashboard -- `dashboards/certs/certificate_overview.json`
  - Stat panels: total certs monitored, expiring <30d, expiring <7d, expired
  - Table: all certs with days until expiry, issuer, cert_type, owner, endpoint
  - Color-coded: green (>90d), yellow (30-90d), orange (<30d), red (<7d)
  - Expiry timeline: upcoming expirations as calendar/timeline view
  - Template vars: cert_type (pki/public), environment, owner
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: Task 3

- [x] 6. Create certificate alert rules -- `alerts/prometheus/cert_alerts.yml`
  - CertExpiringSoon (30 days) -- warning
  - CertExpiringCritical (7 days) -- critical
  - CertExpired (0 days) -- critical
  - CertProbeFailure (endpoint unreachable) -- warning
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: Task 3

- [x] 7. Add blackbox testing to Docker Compose PoC
  - Blackbox is embedded in Alloy -- just needs config mount
  - Create self-signed cert endpoint for local validation testing
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: Task 3

- [x] 8. Update Helm chart for cert monitoring
  - ConfigMap for endpoints.yml and blackbox_modules.yml
  - Volume mount for custom CA bundle (internal PKI trust)
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: Task 7

- [x] 9. Documentation -- `docs/CERTIFICATE_MONITORING.md`
  - Adding endpoints to monitoring (internal and public)
  - Alert thresholds and response procedures
  - Internal PKI vs public cert workflows
  - Blackbox probe behavior: reports earliest expiry in chain (may be intermediate, not leaf)
  - Complexity: Simple

### Risks

- Endpoint reachability: monitoring stack must have network access to all HTTPS endpoints. Mitigation: document firewall requirements.
- Internal PKI trust: blackbox prober needs to trust internal CA root/intermediate certs. Mitigation: CA bundle mount in Alloy container.
- Cert chain reporting: blackbox reports earliest expiry in chain (could be intermediate, not leaf). Mitigation: document behavior, consider x509-exporter supplement for file-based validation.
- Inventory completeness: missing endpoints means missing certs. Mitigation: maintain endpoint inventory in `configs/alloy/certs/endpoints.yml` and review periodically.

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Provide initial list of HTTPS/TLS endpoints to monitor (internal + public)
- [ ] Provide internal CA root and intermediate certificates for trust chain
- [ ] Confirm DigiCert CertCentral API access availability (if using direct API)
- [ ] Review alert thresholds (30d warning, 7d critical are defaults)

---

## Phase 7D: Lansweeper Integration

**Status**: Dropped

**Reason**: Asset inventory is handled entirely by Lansweeper. No monitoring stack integration needed -- the boundary between infrastructure health monitoring (this stack) and asset discovery (Lansweeper) is clear and intentional.

---

## Phase 7E: Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring (Stub)

**Goal**: Placeholder configs for AWS CloudWatch and Azure Monitor integration via native Alloy exporters. Activated when cloud resources are deployed.

**Status**: Completed -- stub configs ready, activate when cloud resources are deployed

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Create stub Alloy configs for cloud exporters
  - `configs/alloy/cloud/aws_cloudwatch.alloy.example` -- commented, with instructions
  - `configs/alloy/cloud/azure_monitor.alloy.example` -- commented, with instructions
  - Documents required IAM roles / Azure service principals
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: None

- [x] 2. Create stub Helm values for cloud integration
  - values.yaml additions with `enabled: false`
  - Document required credentials and permissions per provider
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: None

- [x] 3. Documentation -- `docs/CLOUD_MONITORING.md`
  - Prerequisites per cloud provider (IAM, service principal, API access)
  - Which metrics are available (EC2, RDS, Azure VMs, etc.)
  - Activation workflow
  - Complexity: Simple

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Identify which cloud provider(s) are in use (when ready)
- [ ] Create IAM role or Azure service principal with read-only metrics access

---

## Phase 7F: IIS Dedicated Dashboard

**Goal**: Build a dedicated IIS Web Server dashboard. The Alloy role config (`role_iis.alloy`) and alert rules (`role_alerts.yml`) already exist and are proven -- IIS metrics are collected but only visible in the generic Windows overview dashboard.

**Status**: Pending

### Tasks

- [ ] 1. Create IIS Server dashboard -- `dashboards/windows/iis_overview.json`
  - Per-site request rates (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE breakdown)
  - 5xx and 4xx error rates with status code breakdown
  - Active connections and connection rate over time
  - Bytes sent/received throughput per site
  - App pool worker process health and recycle counts
  - W3C access log volume and top status codes (LogQL from Loki)
  - Request queue length
  - Template vars: environment, datacenter, hostname, site_name
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: None (IIS Alloy config and alerts already exist)

- [ ] 2. Create IIS recording rules -- `configs/prometheus/iis_recording_rules.yml`
  - Pre-computed request rates and error ratios per site
  - Connection rate aggregations
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: None

- [ ] 3. Update Grafana dashboard provisioning for new directories
  - Add `network/`, `hardware/`, `certs/`, `assets/` to provisioning config
  - One-time task that covers all Phase 7 sub-phases
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: None

### Risks

- Minimal. IIS metrics are already collected and validated in the Docker Compose PoC.

### Human Actions Required

- None (uses existing Alloy config and metrics)

---

## Phase 7G: Agentless Collection (Edge Cases)

**Goal**: WinRM and SSH-based remote metric and log collection for devices where Alloy agent installation is not possible (vendor appliances, embedded systems, locked-down hosts).

**Status**: Blocked -- requires internal use case identification before any implementation

**Gate**: Task 1 must produce a finite target list with justification before any code is written. This phase does not proceed speculatively.

### Tasks

- [ ] 1. Identify agentless targets (INTERNAL ACTION)
  - Catalog devices where agent installation is blocked
  - Document reason for each (vendor restriction, no OS access, embedded firmware, etc.)
  - Classify: WinRM-capable vs SSH-capable vs neither
  - Deliver target list with justification
  - Complexity: Simple (process, not code)
  - Dependencies: Internal team review

- [ ] 2. Design agentless collection architecture
  - WinRM: Alloy proxy instance running PowerShell scrapers remotely, or script_exporter executing remote commands
  - SSH: Alloy proxy instance with remote node_exporter textfile collector pushed via SCP, or SSH-based command execution
  - Architecture decision: one proxy per site vs centralized
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: Task 1 (must know what devices and what to collect)

- [ ] 3. Create proxy Alloy configs -- `configs/alloy/roles/role_agentless_proxy.alloy`
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: Task 2

- [ ] 4. Create agentless targets inventory -- `configs/alloy/agentless/targets.yml`
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: Task 1

- [ ] 5. Alert rules and dashboard panels for agentless targets
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: Task 3

- [x] 6. Documentation -- `docs/AGENTLESS_MONITORING.md`
  - Decision tree: when to use agentless vs agent-based
  - Security considerations (credential storage, WinRM hardening, SSH key management)
  - Complexity: Simple

### Risks

- Scope creep: agentless can become a rabbit hole if not scoped tightly. Mitigation: strict gate on Task 1 -- finite target list required before implementation.
- Credential management: WinRM/SSH credentials for remote hosts are sensitive. Mitigation: Kerberos delegation or SSH key auth, never stored in config files.
- Reliability: remote collection is inherently less reliable than local agent. Mitigation: document SLA expectations, add probe-up alerts for agentless targets.

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Identify devices where agent installation is not possible
- [ ] Document reason for each (vendor restriction, embedded firmware, access limitation, etc.)
- [ ] Provide WinRM/SSH credentials or authentication method for each target
- [ ] Approve agentless scope before implementation begins

---

## Phase 7H: Dashboard Hub Architecture

**Goal**: Create a location-centric navigation layer across all monitoring domains. Two dashboards: an Enterprise NOC view showing all sites at a glance, and a Site Overview dashboard showing all monitored infrastructure at a single site/location with drill-down links to detailed dashboards.

**Status**: Completed

**Audience**: Both central NOC team (multi-site comparison, problem identification) and site IT staff (single-site deep visibility, troubleshooting).

**Scope**: Servers and actively monitored infrastructure only. Asset/endpoint inventory is out of scope (handled externally).

**Design Principle**: These dashboards are additive -- they consume metrics from all other phases. Each Phase 7 sub-phase adds a new row/section to the Site Overview and a new column to the Enterprise NOC grid. Ship the framework with server + IIS data now; SNMP, hardware, and cert sections land as those phases complete.

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Create Enterprise NOC dashboard -- `dashboards/overview/enterprise_noc.json`
  - Multi-site health grid: one row per datacenter/site, columns for each monitoring domain
  - Domain columns (grow as phases ship):
    - Servers: count, avg CPU, avg memory, services down
    - IIS: request rate, 5xx error rate (when Phase 7F metrics exist)
    - Network: devices up/down, interfaces down, high utilization, errors (Phase 7A -- live)
    - Hardware: chassis health OK/warning/critical, temperature, power (Phase 7B -- live)
    - Certificates: expiring <30d count (when Phase 7C ships)
  - Active alert count per site with severity breakdown
  - Top-N worst sites ranking (by combined health score)
  - Each site name is a clickable link to the Site Overview dashboard pre-filtered to that site
  - Template vars: environment (for filtering prod/staging/dev)
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: Phase 7F complete (server + IIS recording rules provide initial data)

- [x] 2. Create Site Overview dashboard -- `dashboards/overview/site_overview.json`
  - Single `datacenter` variable (single-select, not multi) as the site selector
  - Row: Site Health Summary
    - Stat panels: total servers, total alerts, total services down, uptime SLA %
  - Row: Server Health
    - Windows server count, avg CPU, avg memory, worst disk free
    - Linux server count, avg CPU, avg memory, worst disk free
    - Link to Windows/Linux Overview dashboards (inherits site filter)
  - Row: IIS Web Services
    - Total request rate, 5xx error rate, active connections
    - Link to IIS Overview dashboard (inherits site filter)
  - Row: Network Infrastructure (Phase 7A -- live)
    - Device inventory table (status, uptime, type, vendor), traffic timeseries
    - Link to Network Infrastructure dashboard
  - Row: Hardware Health (Phase 7B -- live)
    - Server health table (health, power state, temperature, power draw)
    - Link to Hardware Health dashboard
  - Row: Certificate Status (placeholder until Phase 7C)
    - Certs expiring <30d, <7d, expired count
    - Link to Certificate Overview dashboard
  - Row: Active Alerts for This Site
    - Table of firing alerts filtered by datacenter label
  - Row: Recent Logs for This Site
    - Combined Windows Event Log + Linux journal + IIS access log stream from Loki
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: Phase 7F complete (server + IIS recording rules provide initial data)

- [x] 3. Create fleet-level recording rules for site aggregation -- `configs/prometheus/site_recording_rules.yml`
  - Per-site server counts: `site:servers_reporting:count`
  - Per-site avg CPU: `site:cpu_utilization:avg`
  - Per-site avg memory: `site:memory_utilization:avg`
  - Per-site worst disk free: `site:disk_free:min`
  - Per-site services not running: `site:services_not_running:sum`
  - Per-site IIS request rate: `site:iis_request_rate:sum` (when IIS metrics exist)
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: None (uses existing instance-level recording rules)

- [x] 4. Add cross-dashboard link navigation to all existing dashboards
  - Add a dashboard link bar to Windows, Linux, IIS, and Infrastructure Overview dashboards
  - Links pass current template variable values (`$datacenter`, `$environment`) to target dashboards
  - Consistent navigation: every dashboard can reach the Enterprise NOC and Site Overview
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: Tasks 1, 2

- [x] 5. Update placeholder rows as Phase 7 sub-phases complete
  - 7A: Network rows populated with SNMP recording rules, NOC site table with drill-down
  - 7B: Hardware rows populated with Redfish metrics, NOC site table with drill-down
  - 7C: Certificate rows populated with blackbox metrics (completed previously)
  - Remaining: only Phase 7E+ sub-phases (if dashboard integration needed)

### Architecture Notes

- **Link inheritance**: Grafana supports passing template variables via URL parameters. The Enterprise NOC links to Site Overview with `?var-datacenter=SITE-A`. Site Overview links to detailed dashboards with `?var-datacenter=$datacenter&var-environment=$environment`. This creates seamless drill-down without requiring users to re-select filters.
- **Placeholder rows**: Network (7A), Hardware (7B), and Certificate (7C) rows are now populated with real queries and drill-down links. Future Phase 7 sub-phases (7E+) follow the same pattern if dashboard integration is needed.
- **Dashboard UIDs**: `enterprise-noc`, `site-overview`. All dashboards reference these UIDs in their link definitions for stability across Grafana upgrades.

### Risks

- Dashboard complexity: the Enterprise NOC grid queries many recording rules simultaneously. Mitigation: all queries use pre-computed recording rules (not raw metrics), keeping dashboard load time fast.
- Placeholder row maintenance: Network, Hardware, and Certificate placeholder rows are now populated. Only future Phase 7 sub-phases (7E+) may need dashboard integration.
- Template variable cascade: passing variables between dashboards requires consistent naming (`datacenter` everywhere, not `site` in some places). Mitigation: existing dashboards already use a consistent taxonomy.

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Review Enterprise NOC layout with operations team
- [ ] Confirm which sites should appear in the NOC grid (all sites, or only production?)
- [ ] Provide feedback on Site Overview row ordering and priority

## Phase 8: Access Control and RBAC

**Goal**: Implement Grafana folder-based RBAC with LDAP/AD group synchronization for tiered dashboard visibility. Each site's IT team sees only their own infrastructure. Enterprise operations sees everything. User onboarding is a single AD group add -- no Grafana admin action needed.

**Status**: Completed

**Prerequisite**: Phase C (LDAP authentication) in Helm chart, Phase 7H (dashboard folder structure exists)

**Identity Platform**: Hybrid AD / Entra ID. Grafana authenticates via LDAP against on-premises domain controllers. Entra ID syncs users and groups to on-prem AD via Azure AD Connect. The LDAP source is always the on-prem DC.

**Architecture Reference**: See [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the access tier model, folder structure, team-to-folder permission model, and LDAP group sync design.

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Create dashboard folder provisioning config -- `configs/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/`
  - Restructure dashboard provisioning to use per-site folders instead of per-category folders
  - Folder structure: `Enterprise/`, `Site - <name>/` (one per site), `Shared/`
  - Existing dashboards redistributed: Enterprise NOC -> `Enterprise/`, site-specific dashboards -> `Site - <name>/`, cross-site dashboards (log explorer, cert overview) -> `Shared/`
  - Folder names are templatized with placeholder site names (deployers replace per fork)
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: None

- [x] 2. Create Grafana Team provisioning config -- `configs/grafana/provisioning/teams/`
  - Provisioning YAML defining Grafana Teams: `Enterprise Ops`, per-site teams (e.g., `DC-East Ops`), `Stakeholders`
  - Team names templatized with placeholder site names
  - Evaluate whether Grafana provisioning API supports team-folder permission bindings (may require API calls or Terraform)
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: Task 1

- [x] 3. Create folder permission provisioning
  - Remove default org-level Viewer permission from site folders
  - Grant `Enterprise Ops` team Editor on all folders
  - Grant each site team Viewer on their site folder and `Shared/`
  - Grant `Stakeholders` team Viewer on `Enterprise/` only
  - Evaluate: Grafana provisioning vs Terraform vs API script for permission management
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: Tasks 1, 2

- [x] 4. Create LDAP configuration -- `configs/grafana/ldap.toml`
  - LDAP server connection (LDAPS on port 636)
  - Bind DN for service account authentication
  - User search base and filter (`sAMAccountName` for AD, `uid` for standard LDAP)
  - Group search base and filter for AD security groups
  - Group-to-Team mapping: `SG-Monitoring-Admins` -> `Enterprise Ops`, `SG-Monitoring-<Site>` -> `<Site> Ops`, etc.
  - Auto-provisioning: create Grafana user on first LDAP login
  - Default org role for new users: `Viewer`
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: None (configuration, but tested with Tasks 1-3)

- [x] 5. Update Grafana configuration for LDAP auth -- `configs/grafana/grafana.ini` or env vars
  - Enable LDAP authentication (`auth.ldap.enabled = true`)
  - Set LDAP config file path (`auth.ldap.config_file = /etc/grafana/ldap.toml`)
  - Configure auto-provisioning behavior (sync interval, allow sign-up)
  - Disable basic auth if LDAP is the sole auth method (or keep as fallback)
  - Complexity: Simple
  - Dependencies: Task 4

- [x] 6. Update Helm chart for RBAC support
  - Add `ldap.toml` to Grafana ConfigMap or Secret (contains bind password)
  - Add `grafana.ini` overrides for LDAP auth settings
  - Add values.yaml fields for LDAP connection, group mapping, and team provisioning
  - Add folder permission provisioning to Grafana init container or startup script
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: Tasks 1-5

- [x] 7. Create RBAC testing and validation script -- `scripts/validate_rbac.py`
  - Validate folder structure matches expected site list
  - Validate Team provisioning against expected AD group mapping
  - Validate folder permissions (each site folder accessible only by correct team)
  - Test mode: connects to running Grafana instance, queries API, reports compliance
  - Dry-run mode: validates config files without a running instance
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: Tasks 1-3

- [x] 8. Document RBAC setup and operations -- `docs/RBAC_GUIDE.md`
  - Prerequisites: AD security groups created, LDAP service account, Grafana LDAP config
  - Step-by-step: adding a new site (folder + team + AD group + permissions)
  - Step-by-step: onboarding a new team member (AD group add only)
  - Step-by-step: offboarding (AD group remove -- Grafana session revoked on next sync)
  - Troubleshooting: LDAP bind failures, group sync delays, permission issues
  - AD group naming convention: `SG-Monitoring-<Site>` or organization-specific prefix
  - Hybrid AD / Entra ID specifics: which DC to bind against, Azure AD Connect sync timing
  - Complexity: Medium
  - Dependencies: Tasks 1-6

### Architecture Notes

- **Folder-based isolation over Grafana Organizations**: Single Org with folder-level permissions is simpler than multi-Org. Multi-Org would require duplicating datasources and dashboards per org. Folder permissions achieve site isolation without duplication.
- **LDAP over Entra ID OAuth**: Hybrid AD/Entra ID environments have both identity sources. LDAP is chosen because it provides group sync natively (AD security groups -> Grafana Teams). Entra ID OAuth would require Grafana Enterprise for team sync via Azure AD groups. LDAP against on-prem DC is available with Grafana OSS.
- **Auto-provisioning**: New users are created in Grafana on first LDAP login with the default Viewer role. Team membership is determined by AD group sync. No manual Grafana account creation needed.
- **Template variable scoping**: Dashboard template variables filter data by `datacenter` label. Even if a user could somehow access a dashboard outside their folder, they would only see data for sites whose `ALLOY_DATACENTER` labels match their site. Folder permissions are the primary access control; label scoping is a secondary data boundary.

### Risks

- **Grafana provisioning limitations**: Grafana's file-based provisioning may not support team-folder permission bindings. Mitigation: evaluate API-based provisioning (Terraform, init container script) as alternative.
- **LDAP group sync latency**: AD group changes may take 5-15 minutes to sync to Grafana. Mitigation: document expected sync interval, provide manual sync API endpoint.
- **Multi-domain complexity**: Hybrid AD/Entra ID with multiple on-prem domains may require multiple LDAP server entries. Mitigation: document multi-domain configuration, test against primary domain first.
- **Grafana version dependency**: LDAP team sync behavior varies across Grafana versions. Mitigation: document minimum Grafana version, test against the version deployed.

### Human Actions Required

- [ ] Create AD security groups following the `SG-Monitoring-<Site>` convention (or provide naming convention)
- [ ] Provide list of sites/datacenters that need separate dashboard visibility
- [ ] Create an LDAP service account (read-only, bind access to user and group OUs)
- [ ] Provide LDAP server hostname (on-prem DC), port, bind DN, search bases
- [ ] Identify IT team leads at each site (who approves access requests)
- [ ] Decide whether read-only stakeholder access is needed (management dashboards)
- [ ] Decide whether any sites share IT staff (impacts Team membership design)
- [ ] Designate Grafana admin account ownership (who holds the admin password long-term)

## Phase 9: Requirements Gap Closure

**Goal**: Close all internally-solvable gaps identified in the team requirements analysis (see `docs/REQUIREMENTS_RESPONSE.md`). Eliminates the 15-20% feature delta between the internal stack and paid platforms, making the build-vs-buy decision definitive on cost.

### Execution Order

```
Week 1:
  Day 1-2:  Group A (probing) + Group B (file size, process monitoring)
            All additive new files, zero risk to existing configs
  Day 3-4:  Group C (dashboards, SLA, forecasting)
            Depends on Group A for probing dashboard; SLA is standalone
  Day 5:    Group D (alert dedup)
            Recording rules first, then inhibition rules

Week 2:
  Day 6:    Group E (maintenance windows)
            Independent of other groups
  Day 7-8:  Group F (SNMP traps)
            Most complex, new data flow pipeline
  Day 9-10: Group G (audit logging)
            Requires Grafana config understanding

Week 3:
  Day 11:   Group H (validation and documentation)
            Runs validators, updates deployment configs, writes docs
```

### Risks

- **ICMP probes require NET_RAW capability**: Blackbox exporter in a container needs the NET_RAW capability for ICMP. Mitigation: document container capability requirement, test in Docker Compose PoC.
- **SNMP trap pipeline adds snmptrapd dependency**: New external component. Mitigation: document as optional, trap pipeline only deployed at sites that need it.
- **Grafana audit log format may vary between versions**: Label extraction pipeline assumes specific JSON fields. Mitigation: pin expected log fields, document tested Grafana version.
- **SLA recording rules cardinality on large fleets**: Per-host daily availability could be expensive. Mitigation: aggregate by role and datacenter in recording rules, per-host available via instant queries only.
- **predict_linear confidence decreases over long extrapolation**: Mitigation: add panel description explaining projection methodology and limitations.

### Success Criteria

- All new alert rules load without error in Prometheus
- All new dashboards pass validate_dashboards.py (JSON syntax, UID uniqueness, datasource refs)
- All new recording rules pass validate_prometheus.py (YAML syntax, duration format, label compliance)
- Docker Compose PoC starts cleanly with all new configs mounted
- Helm chart templates render correctly with new ConfigMap entries
- validate_all.py passes with zero failures
- REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md maps every non-decision-dependent requirement to a delivering phase

### Human Actions Required

None for Phase 9. All work is configuration. Deployment-time customization (probe target lists, process names, file paths, SLA targets, trap OID mappings) is documented but not hard-coded.

## Architecture Decisions

### Two-Tier Alloy Deployment Model (Decided 2026-03-06)

All monitoring at each site uses two distinct Alloy deployment patterns:

**Tier 1: Alloy Agent (per-server, push-based)**
- Installed on every Windows and Linux server via SCCM or Ansible
- Monitors the local server (CPU, memory, disk, services, event logs)
- Pushes metrics/logs to Prometheus/Loki via remote_write
- Config: `configs/alloy/common/` + `configs/alloy/windows/` or `configs/alloy/linux/`
- Identity: `ALLOY_DATACENTER` environment variable determines site membership

**Tier 2: Alloy Site Gateway (one container per site, pull-based)**
- Single container/pod at each site that polls all non-server infrastructure
- Handles three pull-based monitoring patterns from one deployment:
  - SNMP polling (switches, firewalls, APs, UPS, NAS) via `prometheus.exporter.snmp`
  - Certificate probing (HTTPS + TCP/TLS endpoints) via `prometheus.exporter.blackbox`
  - Hardware health (iLO, iDRAC BMC interfaces) via Redfish API exporter
- Requires management VLAN network access to reach device interfaces
- Can run on any server at the site with Docker
- Config: `configs/alloy/gateway/` (unified gateway config)
- Transitions to a K8s pod with zero config changes when NKP arrives

**Per-site deployment checklist:**
1. Install Alloy agent on servers (Tier 1) with `ALLOY_DATACENTER=site-name`
2. Deploy site gateway container (Tier 2) with target lists for that site's devices
3. Populate `targets.yml` files with site-specific device IPs, BMC addresses, cert endpoints

---

## Notes

- Alloy replaces both node_exporter/windows_exporter and Promtail in a single binary
- All configs designed to work with both Prometheus (Phase 1) and Mimir (Phase 2) via remote_write
- Teams notification via Alertmanager webhook -- no MCP or external tooling required
- Python 3.10+ required for validation scripts
- Phase 7 extends monitoring beyond agent-based OS collection to SNMP, hardware, certificates, and cloud
- Network fleet: Cisco switches, Palo Alto firewalls, Ubiquiti APs/switches
- HCI fleet: HPE SimpliVity (iLO) + Dell (iDRAC), firmware kept current
- Certificate monitoring covers both internal PKI and public DigiCert certificates
- Phase 7 execution order: 7F (done) -> 7H (done) -> 7C (done) -> 7A (done) -> 7B (done) -> 7D (dropped) -> 7E (cloud) -> 7G (agentless, blocked)
- Phase 7H (dashboard hub) ships right after 7F with server + IIS data; grows incrementally as each sub-phase adds its monitoring domain
- Kubernetes platform: Nutanix NKP (Nutanix Kubernetes Platform) in datacenter infrastructure
- Persistent storage: Nutanix CSI driver with Nutanix Volumes storage class for all PVCs (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana)
- Mimir object storage (Phase 6): Nutanix Objects (S3-compatible) is a candidate backend
